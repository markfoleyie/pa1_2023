'''Print Character table

Attempts to output representation of encoded characters in decimal range supplied by user. Encodings output determined
by list. Prints decimal value, hex equivalent, printable character (glyph) if possible and representation as bytes
object, which may render as "b'<glyph>'" or "b'<hex value>[<hex value>]...'" Bytes object can be represented as more
than one hex value.
